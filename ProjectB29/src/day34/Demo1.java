//Manual process for updating selenium jar file is
/*
 * 1. Download new jar
 * 2. Copy paste it into required location
 * 3. add jar to build path
 * 4. remove old jar from build path
 * This is a tedious process.. so we can also automate this using Maven tool.
 * It is build tool or dependency tool.
 * instead of we updating jar file on behalf of us,Maven does automatically hence that tool is called maven.
 * POM: Project Object Model in Maven
 * POM: Page object model in testng
 * Group id----organization
 * artifact id----project name
 * version-----build number
 *
